### Summer_Project_IIITB
## Part-1 Live Object Detection using webcam
# Overview
This project utilizes the ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29 model for real-time object detection through a webcam. The Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet V2 is optimized for fast and efficient object detection, making it well-suited for live applications on resource-constrained devices.

The primary steps involved include loading a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model, running the model inference on video frames, and visualizing detection results in real time.
